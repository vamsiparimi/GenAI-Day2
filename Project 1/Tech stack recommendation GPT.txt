To create a Technology Stack Recommendation GPT with the specified instructions, you'll need to follow a structured process. Here’s a breakdown of the steps and how you might implement them:

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Document Analysis
Ask for Document Summary:
Prompt: "Would you like a summary of the document you’ve uploaded? (Yes/No)"
If “Yes”:
Provide a summary of the document in 9-10 easy-to-understand points.
Count and report the number of sentences, tokens, and stopwords in the document.
If “No”:
Proceed to the next step.
Step 2: Tokenization Process
Explain Tokenization:

Prompt: "Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or sentences. It helps in analyzing the structure of the text more effectively."
Prompt: "We will now perform sentence tokenization, which breaks the text into individual sentences."
Perform Sentence Tokenization:

Count and report the number of sentence tokens.
Prompt: "Do you understand the process of tokenization? (Yes/No)"
If “No,” provide a simpler explanation with an example.
If “Yes,” proceed to the next step.
Step 3: Identifying Relevant and Irrelevant Sentences
Explain Exploration and Exploitation:

Prompt: "Exploration involves trying new things and experimenting to discover novel approaches, while exploitation focuses on refining and optimizing existing strategies. Both are crucial for balancing innovation and efficiency in an organization."
Prompt: "Shall we proceed to identifying relevant and irrelevant sentences?"
Identify Relevant Sentences:

Extract sentences that add value to the business based on the criteria provided.
Prompt: "Here is a list of sentences that are relevant to your business objectives."
Report the total number of relevant sentences.
Identify Irrelevant Sentences:

Extract sentences that are off-topic, vague, or redundant.
Prompt: "Here is a list of sentences that are not relevant to your business objectives."
Report the total number of irrelevant sentences.
Create a 2x2 Matrix:

Use matplotlib to plot a matrix showing the number of relevant and irrelevant sentences and tokens.
Prompt: "Here is a 2x2 matrix showing the distribution of relevant and irrelevant sentences and tokens."
Step 4: Applying Exploration and Exploitation Strategy
Identify Key Themes:

Analyze the document using the exploration and exploitation framework to suggest strategies.
Prompt: "We’ll now identify key themes in your document and suggest preliminary strategies for balancing exploration and exploitation."
Proceed or Explore Ideal Strategies:

Prompt: "Would you like to proceed with further steps or see what an ideal exploration and exploitation strategy looks like for your industry? (Yes/No)"
If “Yes,” ask the user for their industry and gather information to provide an ideal strategy.
Inform the user that you will now proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: Detailed Analysis of Exploration and Exploitation
Classify Sentences:
Prompt: "Shall we list sentences that are heavily focused on exploitation and those focused on exploration?"
Extract and list sentences fitting each category.
Report the total number of sentences that are exploration-heavy and exploitation-heavy.
Implementation Notes
Libraries and Tools: Use Python libraries like nltk, spaCy, or matplotlib for tokenization and plotting.
User Interaction: Ensure clear prompts and responses to guide the user through each step.
Documentation: Provide detailed instructions and summaries to help users understand the process and results.
This structure will guide the creation of your GPT model for technology stack recommendations while integrating the exploration and exploitation strategy. If you need any help with specific implementations or further details, feel free to ask!
